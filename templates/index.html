            <!-- <img src="logo.JPG" alt="sjjs"> -->
            <p>Detecting fetal size is crucial for monitoring prenatal development. Using ultrasound, healthcare providers measure parameters like crown-rump length, biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference, and femur length. These measurements aid in determining gestational age and identifying potential growth abnormalities. Anomalies, such as intrauterine growth restriction or macrosomia, can signal health risks for both mother and baby. Regular ultrasound scans throughout pregnancy enable healthcare professionals to track fetal growth and make informed decisions about interventions if necessary. This proactive approach ensures the well-being of both the mother and the developing baby. By closely monitoring fetal size, healthcare providers can address any concerns promptly, contributing to a healthier pregnancy and a better outcome for both mother and child.
